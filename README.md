Users will join the lobby by clicking a sign.
Players will continue to join the lobby till the minimum number of players to play the game has joined.
Then a timer will start counting down from 30(default set in config) once time reaches 0, the players will be teleported to the arena(position set in config)

Once in the arena users will run around as a random block of sand falls every 3 seconds(configurable in config) and the last player(s) left when time runs out(configurable in config) wins
